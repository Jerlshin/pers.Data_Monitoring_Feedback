VERCEL -- deploy the frontend 
ATLAS -- deploy the datasbase

Along with the other two graphs, i want to "ADD" another graph to the webpage. 

The graph should have just 



all on positive graphs... 

all these values should be line plots included in "single" graph. all these 5 plots should be made in 1 graph (3rd graph). So, can you give code for both.

THe 3rd should also follow the same styling as other 2 graphs
